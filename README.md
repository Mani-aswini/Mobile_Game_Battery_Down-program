# Mobile_Game_Battery_Down-program
Mobile Game Battery Drain -->
You are designing a mobile game where every move made by a player drains some battery. Each move has a drain value (integer). The rule of the game is that each move can be used at most twice.

Your task:-
Store all possible moves in an ArrayList.
Calculate the total possible drain using those moves.
If the total possible drain is less than the given battery power, then the player cannot drain the battery to zero.
Otherwise, it is possible to drain the battery completely.

Input Format:-
The first line contains an integer B → the battery capacity.
The second line contains an integer N → the number of moves.
The third line contains N integers, representing the drain values of the moves.

Output Format:-
Print "Possible" if the battery can be fully drained.
Print "Cannot reach zero if the total drain is insufficient.
